# Memo: 2d game math x physics (pre now making)

This Book write about 2dgame physics and math. I am making a 2d game library to get this knowledge now.

This Book follow these concept.


## Umiuni2D
Umiuni2D is 2D Game Library for writing this book.
https://github.com/kyorohiro/doc_2dgame


#### Use Dart
Umiuni2D use flutter and Dart and WebGL as Develop Environment.

#### Multiplatform library
Umiuni2D's game is executable on android and iOS and modern browser.
